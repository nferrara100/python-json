Connect4 Connect4 is a grid-based game, where players take it in turns to add tokens.
The winner is whoever manages to line up 4 pieces, in any direction, first. Diagonals
are allowed. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four An online version can be found
here.

Tasks The aim is to develop an interactive version of the game which the candidate and
interviewer can play together. A simple, text-based, representation of the grid is
encouraged to start with. For example, you might use '.' for empty slots, and 'x' and
'o' for pieces of the two players. Players can input their turns via the REPL. A minimal
version of the game should support:

a 6 x 7 grid players play pieces sequentially the game identifies winning turns and ends
at that point
